## Baseline: v1.0.8, 7 October 2026

A dev build of `083d92e` (v1.0.8) was profiled for 27 minutes of ordinary use: searching, scrolling the transcript of a session that wasn't running, switching tabs, and running CLIs in terminals. The recording was made in 13 two-minute chunks.

| Measure | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Main thread busy | 269 s in total; 7–37% of each chunk, 44 s of 120 s in the worst |
| Freezes (Hangs instrument) | 18, from 257 to 523 ms; 15 of them between 18:33 and 18:36, while reading and searching a transcript |
| Background CPU | 1–5 s per chunk; one 6 s burst of message-search indexing used 2.4 cores |

The main thread's 269 busy seconds went to two kinds of work. **Terminals** are the largest steady cost; **SwiftUI** causes the freezes.

| Work | Share | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Terminal drawing | 43% | SwiftTerm drawing rows on the CPU. In chunks spent mostly in terminals, it was 57–69% of the busy time, at up to 200 ms per second. Parsing the same output took about 12 ms per second. |
| Terminal output parsing | 13% | SwiftTerm reading the CLIs' output. |
| SwiftUI updates | 13% | Re-rendering the window's one view tree. |
| Other layout and drawing | 11% | The rest of each display cycle. |
| Hover, hit testing, and cursor updates | 8% | Run on mouse moves, through every view in the transcript: 28% of the busy time in the worst chunk. |
| Accessibility | 5% | Includes SwiftUI walking the whole responder tree to find the accessibility focus. |
| Transcript text bodies | 1% | 1.3 s in one chunk, copying text to search it with no search active. |

The accessibility walk was most of each freeze. SwiftUI only does it while an accessibility client is connected, such as Raycast, a window manager, a password manager, or VoiceOver. cmux measured Raycast querying a window about [32 times a second](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/2985).

The tree is large because the transcript lays out every loaded entry, up to `TranscriptPagingModel.maximumRetainedPageCount` pages. It uses a plain `VStack` on purpose; see `TranscriptScrollView.transcriptEntries`.

### 1. Timestamp parsing

**Evidence:** the 14 s indexing burst spent 2.9 s in `ISO8601DateFormatter`, which parses through ICU. Its two shared formatters sat behind one lock, so the indexer's parallel readers also waited for each other.

**Change:** `ISO8601TimestampParser` uses `Date.ISO8601FormatStyle`. In a benchmark of 200,000 timestamps it took 0.52 µs each, against 28 µs, and as a value it needs no lock. On 1,380 timestamps sampled from local Claude, Codex, Gemini, and pi sessions, it gave the same dates. On other inputs:

- **Finer fractions:** it keeps micro- and nanoseconds, which the formatter cut to milliseconds.
- **A leap second (`:60`):** it accepts it, which the formatter didn't.
- **A leading space:** it rejects it, which the formatter accepted. No CLI writes either form.

### 2. Transcript text searches only during Find

**Evidence:** `TranscriptSearchableText` copied its whole text into a `String` and searched it on every body evaluation, even with no query. It also read the whole environment with `@Environment(\.self)`, so any environment change re-ran it ([objc.io](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E409-environment-preference-updates)).

**Change:** without a query, the body returns plain `Text` straight away. Only the view that draws highlighted matches reads the whole environment, which it needs to resolve theme colors.

### 3. Fast `AttributedString` to `String` conversion

**Evidence:** the indexing burst spent 1.9 s in the standard library's generic `String.init`, reading an `AttributedString` one character at a time. The cause is the SDK, not the code:

- Built with the macOS 26.5 SDK, as the release workflow's `macos-latest` runner builds, `String(text.characters)` compiles to the generic `String.init`.
- Built with Xcode 27's SDK, it calls Foundation's own conversion.
- `String(text.characters[...])` calls Foundation's conversion with either SDK.

On 10,163 text blocks from real Claude replies, the 26.5 SDK build took 348 ms the first way and 3.5 ms the second, with identical results. The v1.0.8 release binary calls the generic initializer in:
- `PreparedTranscriptMarkdown`, which prepares every transcript page;
- the search segments;
- `TranscriptSearchableText`;
- search highlighting;
- the Markdown parser's code blocks.

**Change:** these call sites now use `plainText`, which converts through the slice. Search highlighting also stops converting the text before each run again, which made it quadratic in the number of runs.

The Markdown parse itself stays. The search index stores the text as the reader displays it, block by block, so it needs the parsed blocks.

### 4. One position marker view per transcript entry

**Evidence:** each transcript entry has a `TranscriptEntryPositionMarker` background, an `NSViewRepresentable` that records the reading position. Each one adds an AppKit view and a platform responder, and the profile shows every one of them visited:
- by the accessibility focus walk;
- by hit testing on every mouse move;
- by AppKit's tracking-area updates.

**Plan:** track the reading position from the scroll view's geometry instead, so loaded entries add no AppKit views. Measure before and after with the same transcript and a running accessibility client.

### 5. Text selection on very long blocks

**Evidence:** cmux found that `Text(...).textSelection(.enabled)` on macOS lays out the whole text, and drag-selecting a long block can freeze the app ([cmux #4625](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/4625)). The transcript enables selection on every Markdown block.

**Plan:** keep live selection under a size limit, and offer **Copy Text** for longer blocks. This is lower priority: the profile caught no selection freezes.

### 6. Terminal drawing: SwiftTerm upgrade, then Metal

**Evidence:** this is the largest steady cost: 43% of the main thread's busy time over the whole recording, and up to a fifth of a core while new output took about 1%. When a change reaches the bottom row, SwiftTerm repaints from the changed rows down to the bottom of the view. TUI status lines and spinners do that constantly. The app uses SwiftTerm 1.15.0 with CPU drawing.

**Plan:**
1. Upgrade to SwiftTerm 1.20.0. Version 1.16.0 notes improved baseline performance, and 1.20.0 is the last release before breaking changes.
2. Then try `setUseMetal(true)`. The Metal renderer caches each row and rebuilds only changed rows.
3. Check visually: selection, insets, transparency, the cursor, and the app's own drawing.

The draft line-layout cache ([SwiftTerm #449](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm/pull/449)) is not merged.

### 7. The search context changes on every transcript update

**Evidence:** `TranscriptScrollView` sets `transcriptSearchContext` with a new `reveal` closure on every body evaluation. SwiftUI can't compare closures, so each transcript update, such as the visible entry changing while you scroll, likely re-runs every text block and tool-call list. Item 2 makes those runs cheap; this item would stop them.

**Plan:** confirm with the SwiftUI instrument. If confirmed, make the context compare equal while only the closure differs: for example, hold the position controller and compare it by identity.

## How to profile

Attach to a running copy, so you keep your windows and sessions. Record in chunks, so you can analyze finished chunks while still using the app:

```sh
pid=$(pgrep -f 'JustSessions.app/Contents/MacOS/JustSessions' | head -1)
xcrun xctrace record --template 'Time Profiler' --instrument Hangs --attach "$pid" --time-limit 120s --output chunk.trace
xcrun xctrace export --input chunk.trace --xpath '/trace-toc/run[@number="1"]/data/table[@schema="time-profile"]' > samples.xml
xcrun xctrace export --input chunk.trace --xpath '/trace-toc/run[@number="1"]/data/table[@schema="potential-hangs"]' > hangs.xml
```

Or open the trace in Instruments. Keep these points in mind:

- **Leave the SwiftUI instrument out of CPU profiles.** Its tracing shows up in the samples. Record it separately and briefly to find which state changes cause updates.
- **Profile a build made like the release.** The release is built on GitHub's `macos-latest` runner, with the macOS 26.5 SDK for v1.0.8. A build with a newer local SDK can compile some calls differently, as item 3 shows. Check a binary's SDK with `otool -l <binary> | grep -A4 LC_BUILD_VERSION`, and build with the Command Line Tools' SDK by setting `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`.
- **Test with an accessibility client running.** Many users run Raycast or a window manager, and SwiftUI's accessibility work only happens while one is connected.
- **Measurement suites:** `SidebarInteractionMeasurements` and `TerminalVisibilityMeasurements` in `Tests/JustSessionsTests/Performance/` measure sidebar interactions and hidden terminals. They record only with `JUSTSESSIONS_PERF=1`; see their doc comments.
